# History:
This is built off of [DBM-SoundEventsPack](https://github.com/DeadlyBossMods/DBM-SoundEventsPack) provided by DBM. I just made made the name and file changes to add different music and sounds.

# Installation:
Just install this with your preferred addon client, or download and unzip and drop the DBM-PersonaMusicPack folder directly into addons folder and DBM-Core version 7.3.24 or higher will be able to detect and add media to Event Sound Options automatically. After that, just configure how you want.
